## Create Meeting Functionality

- I used **`forwardRef`** and **`useImperativeHandle`** hooks to let the parent component control child components.
- Before moving to the next step, the parent checks whether the fields are filled.
- If fields are not filled, validation errors are displayed below the respective input fields.
- I passed **meeting data as a prop** to collect and share data across all components.
- Each component uses **React Hook Form** for handling input fields.
- For date inputs, I integrated a **DatePicker** component.
- Finally, in the last step, there is a **‚ÄúCreate Meeting‚Äù** button that triggers meeting creation.

### Your Invitations

- Fetch **pending invitations** from the API and store them in the `pendingInvitations` state.
- Each invitation has two buttons: **Accept** and **Decline**.
- Clicking **Accept** sets `acceptModal` to `true` and stores the selected invite in `selectedInvite`.
- Clicking **Decline** sets `showDeclineModal` to `true` and stores the invite ID in `inviteId`.
- After clicking either button, the respective modal opens: **Location Modal** for Accept, **Confirmation Modal** for Decline.
- The **Confirmation Modal** asks for a simple **Yes/No** confirmation.
- The **Location Modal** checks for conflicts if the user already has another meeting at the same time.
- If conflicts exist and the user clicks **Yes, Continue**, all conflicting meetings are rejected, and the modal proceeds to collect the user‚Äôs location.
