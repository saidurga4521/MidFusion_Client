Step 1 — Service Worker + App Shell Caching (simple, high-value)
What we achieve now

Register a service worker in the browser.

Pre-cache core assets (app shell).

Serve cached shell when offline (so app loads).

Keep code minimal and safe for local dev (localhost OK).


🌟 Benefits
1. Offline Support

Users can still access your app when their internet is down.

For example:

Open the app once → assets cached.

Later, even without internet → app loads from Service Worker cache.

In your meeting app, users can still view meeting details already loaded.

2. Faster Loading (Performance)

Cached files load instantly from the local device instead of fetching from the network every time.

First load → from server.

Next loads → almost instant from cache (especially on slow/unstable connections).

3. Reduced Server Load

Static assets (JS, CSS, images) are served from cache.

Backend server only handles new API calls (like creating meetings).

4. SPA Routing Fallback

In React apps, routes like /meeting/123 may fail offline → Service Worker ensures /index.html is served as fallback.

This avoids the “404 page not found” problem when navigating.

5. Foundation for Advanced Features

By starting with caching, you open the door for:

Push Notifications → notify users about upcoming meetings.

Background Sync → let users create/update meetings offline, sync automatically when back online.

Periodic Sync → auto-refresh meetings list in background.

App-like Experience (PWA) → installable app, splash screen, full-screen.

6. Better User Experience

No blank screen on flaky internet.

Users can still interact with cached content.

Gives a native app feel → very useful if you want your app to be used by teams in areas with weak internet.

⚡ Example in Your App

Offline access → A user opens the app, views meeting details. Later, on a train with poor internet → the app still works and shows cached meeting info.

Background sync → If they create a new meeting offline, the Service Worker can sync it with the server when they reconnect.

Push notifications → Remind users about meetings even if the app is closed.

👉 So basically: performance + reliability + new capabilities (notifications, sync, installable app).
